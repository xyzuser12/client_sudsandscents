          <div className="description" style={mainContentStyle}>
            <br />
            At SUDS & SCENTS, we believe that everyone deserves to feel great in their own skin.
          </div>
          <div className="description" style={descriptionStyle}>
            <br />
            We also believe that true personalization is the key to achieving that feeling. That's why we created a brand that offers fully personalized hygiene products, including soap, shampoo, lotion, perfume, and more.
            <br /> <br />
            Our journey began with a simple idea: that personalization is the future of hygiene. We noticed that most hygiene products were one-size-fits-all, using generic formulas that didn't take into account each customer's unique needs and preferences. We saw an opportunity to change that, by offering a wide range of products that are customized to each customer's individual needs.
            <br /> <br />
            At SUDS & SCENTS, we're not just a brand, we're a community. We're here to help you discover your perfect routine, from scent to suds. We're passionate about empowering our customers to feel their best, and we're committed to providing the highest level of personalized care and attention.
